                    Some girl who gets suspened like every week and has detention for the rest of the school year was in my PE class. Thank God that perosn was a girl cause she took out a knife and tried to kill girls (not BOYS)! Before anybody was hurt she was caught and expelled. She's on Hermione Granger's death list.
